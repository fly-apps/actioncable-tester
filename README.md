# Action Cable Tester

<!-- This README should be read by running `./bin/rails server` -->

A simple Rails app to test ActionCable installations.

## Diagnostics

### [TurboStream](/streams/new)

Echo messages from your browser, into a Turbo Stream, and on out to clients. Useful to see if a TurboStream is working and useful for leaving it open to test how timeouts behave.

### [Pinger](/pinger)

Measure the latency between the server and the client via TurboFrames.
