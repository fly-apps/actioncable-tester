<!-- This README should be read by running `./bin/rails server` -->

A simple Rails app to test ActionCable installations.

## Diagnostics

[Turbo Stream](/streams/new) - Echo messages from your browser, into a Turbo Stream, and on out to clients. Useful to see if a TurboStream is working and useful for leaving it open to test how timeouts behave.
